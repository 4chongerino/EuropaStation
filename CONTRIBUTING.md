Yonaguni-specific CONTRIBUTING.md:
- PRs require a signoff from a maintainer before being merged by a second maintainer, or 24 hours to pass for discussion, whichever comes first.
- If your PR adds sprites or changes the map, it should include pictures of the end product.
- PRs should include a changelog - see the changelogs folder for a readme on how to use the system.
- While the codebase is under active development (until otherwise noted) the above requirements can be waived for the sake of development speed.
