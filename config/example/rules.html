<table width = '100%'>
<tr height = '80px'><td>
- <b>No mass-murder, bombings, floodings, etc by non-antagonists.</b> This is griefing and will be dealt with accordingly.
</tr></td>
<tr height = '80px'><td>
- <b>RP is enforced. No netspeak, meme spam, blatant OOC in IC, metagaming, metacommunications or patently absurd character concepts.</b> This -is- SS13, so some leeway for strange or surreal concepts is allowed, but if you are unclear on something in this list, ask an admin.
</tr></td>
<tr height = '80px'><td>
- <b>No ERP (cybersex).</b> This extends to excessive public displays of affection like making out or grinding. We don't care how realistic it is for people on a colony to bump uglies.
</tr></td>
<tr height = '80px'><td>
- <b>You are expected to be competent at a job that you sign up for.</b> This doesn't mean people learning a job are unwelcome, but if you join as a doctor with no understanding of any aspect of medicine you can expect a jobban.
</tr></td>
<tr height = '80px'><td>
- <b>Racism, sexism, questionable content and spamming on OOC mediums are not appreciated.</b> If you're saying something you wouldn't in public, do it at your own peril.
</tr></td>
<tr height = '80px'><td>
- <b>Admins reserve the right to ban you on their own terms.</b> They will be held to scrutiny from the rest of the team and you can always appeal, but ultimately they're trusted to run the server.
